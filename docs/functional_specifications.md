# üìÑ Campaign Performance Optimization Assistant

**Requirements and Functional Specifications**

---

## 1. **Project Purpose and Scope**

The **Campaign Performance Optimization Assistant** is an AI-driven platform that autonomously analyzes digital marketing campaigns, identifies inefficiencies, and delivers actionable recommendations to optimize performance. It simulates the role of a strategic marketing consultant powered by intelligent agents coordinated through an orchestration layer.

## 2. **Core Functional Requirements**

### 2.1 Agentic Architecture

| Agent                    | Description                                                     | Key Functionalities                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Orchestration Agent**  | Central coordinator managing process flow and agent invocations | - State machine control- Iterative refinement- Decision making based on agent output                  |
| **Data Gathering Agent** | Collects and structures relevant campaign data                  | - Integrate mock DB (JSON)- Web scraping (market trends)- Wikipedia API access- Process uploaded docs |
| **Analysis Agent**       | Interprets campaign data and identifies strengths/weaknesses    | - Trend summarization- Keyword/pattern detection- Prompt-based LLM analysis                           |
| **Recommendation Agent** | Generates clear, structured campaign improvement suggestions    | - Uses templates for output- Accepts feedback for improvement- Promotes iterative optimization        |

## 4. **Technical Specifications**

### 4.1 Orchestration & Agent Execution

- **LangGraph**: Used for defining the state machine and cycling between states.
- **State Persistence**: Maintain context and outputs across agent executions.
- **Refinement Logic**: Ability to reroute to previous agents if feedback requires reevaluation.

### 4.2 Tooling per Agent

| Tool Type               | Used By              | Description                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Web Search              | Data Gathering Agent | Get market trends, competitor insights     |
| Wikipedia API           | Data Gathering Agent | Background research                        |
| JSON Mock DB            | Data Gathering Agent | Simulated campaign data                    |
| File Processor          | Data Gathering Agent | Read documents if provided                 |
| LLM Summarization       | Analysis Agent       | Summarize large inputs before analysis     |
| Pattern Detection       | Analysis Agent       | Look for predefined performance indicators |
| Recommendation Template | Recommendation Agent | Format actionable insights                 |
| Feedback Loop           | Orchestration Agent  | Incorporate user or internal corrections   |

### 4.3 Optimization Utilities

- **Summarization Tool**: Prevent context overflow in LLM.
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Context-aware retrieval from mock DB.
- **Semantic Tool Selection**: Match task to best available tool.
- **Memory Management**: Maintain session context across interactions (mocked for now).

## 5. **Non-Functional Requirements**

| Requirement                    | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modularity**                 | Each agent should be independently testable and replaceable          |
| **Scalability**                | Designed to support real API/data inputs in future                   |
| **Feedback-Driven Adaptation** | Learning loop via Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) and self-correction       |
| **Performance**                | Efficient data handling to minimize LLM cost and latency             |
| **Resilience**                 | Fail-safe mechanisms in case a tool or agent fails                   |
| **Explainability**             | All outputs should be traceable and explainable (why a rec was made) |

## 6. **Assumptions & Mocking**

- Mock data will be stored in a simple structured JSON file.
- External APIs (e.g., Wikipedia, search engine) are integrated using stubs or pre-defined results if needed.
- All LLM interactions will be tested with Gemini 2.0 Flash as the initial backend.

---

## 7. **Future Enhancements**

- Plug-and-play real marketing APIs (e.g., Google Ads, Meta Ads)
- GUI interface for campaign management
- Persistent database for tracking optimization history
- KPI tracking dashboard
- Integration with CRM or other marketing analytics tools
